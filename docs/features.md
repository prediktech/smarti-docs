## Benefits
### `Align day to day work with standards and policies`
Keeping organisational protocols alive and active is undeniably difficult. In many organisations a major disconnect exists between standards, procedures, policies and the actual day to day practices of team members. This is a real issue, especially where legislative or industry compliance is required. 
- SMARTi helps to solve this problem through linking the standards and requirements directly to the maturity assessments and compliance checks that are performed. 
- SMARTi provides live reports / dashboards to see at any time how your compliance to the standard is going.
- As actions are performed to address issues compliance is updated automatically.

### `Prevent Spreadsheet mayhem and address the lack of transparency`
When it comes to improvement initiatives and organisational maturity there are normally many spreadsheets at play. Significant risk is introduced through reliance on user maintained data. Where does the spreadsheet sit? Who updated it last and what did they change? Who can access it now its owner is suddenly on leave? Complex spreadsheets soon lead to a lack of transparency with no single version of the truth.
- SMARTi provides a single source of the truth that uses industry leading security (provided by Microsoft Azure). So your data will never get lost.
- By having a system that is always available you remove the "Key Person" risks introduced by custom built spreadsheets.
- Actions, Comments and Evidence provided means the results can be trusted.
- Data is live and can also be extracted to your favourite BI tool for further data mining.

### `Implement any management methodologies`
Consultants and management methodologies are great but they are even better when they can be focused and directed. With clear direction the desired outcome is more likely. 
- We know there are many organisational maturity methodologies. To ensure you receive what you truly need, we provide a high level of flexibility, building assessments that work with the methodology you have adopted. And if you ever need help, our team is here to help guide you along the way.    

### `Automatic scoring and best practices`
Going through the process of capturing your standards, creating assessments to assess compliance and defining plans to prioritise the closing of identified gaps, already puts you in a better position than many. SMARTi then also automatically tracks the maturity scoring over time and because its all connected your assessments are kept up to date, your plans reflect the results of your actions.   

### `Reporting in minutes not days`
Many organisations face the problem when it comes to reporting that highly skilled people spend days "playing" with spreadsheets to get the reports ready. This valuable time that is being lost.
- SMARTi aims to integrate into the daily, rituals and habits of the right people. Providing easy daily updates and notifications so that initiatives are kept on track. Reports are live in the system meaning they can be pulled at the click of a button.
- SMARTi provides dashboards to all users so you can always see what the state of play is.
