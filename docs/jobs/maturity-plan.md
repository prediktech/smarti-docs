# Create a maturity plan
All plans or initiatives are created and managed through the Planning module. To access plans, select _PLANNING_ from the menu bar and click on _INITIATIVE / PLAN_. 

>NB: The planning module must be enabled, and users set up to use the planning module, by a system administrator. If you are unable to access the Planning modeule, please check with your system administrator that it has been enabled and you have access.

You may have multiple plans, however only one plan may be active at any one time. The key results available are based on the current plan only.

Plans must be associated with an objective, and cannot be created without first creating and objective.

A maturity plan is linked to assessments and the maturity scores and targets are set based on those assessments. 

To create a new plan, click NEW on the right of the screen. A dialogue will be shown prompting you to enter details for the plan.
