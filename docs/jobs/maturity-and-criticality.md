# How does maturity and criticality align?
Within the application, it is good practice to align maturity with criticality.  This is to emphasise the requirement for criticality to be understood as this relates to risk and 2nd Line Assurance (Risk). Many questions can be specific to a given criticality, as defined below.

- **M1:** High Criticality. High criticality devices are essential for the safe operation of the plant and used as part of basic interlocks, control and alarming.
- **M2:** Medium Criticality. Medium criticality devices enable basic control function for the plant.
- **M3:** Low Criticality (“Other”). Other devices are not essential to routine operation however may enable higher orders of control function.
