# Assessor 
Assessors in the system are people who "assess" review and approve submissions.

Assessors will likely have the ability to create assessment submissions, allocate those submissions and then review the results when they have been completed.

Approved submissions will contain a number of actions that have been agreed upon between the organisation, accountable user and the assessor. These actions form the "Maturity Plan" for the next period. If the assessor has planning rights they can also create the required plans.

## Tasks
- Define required submissions
- Assign accountable teams to submissions
- Request feedback on a specific submission
- Define the submission frequency and due dates
- Review the submissions once complete (in collaboration with the accountable person)
- Adjust submission responses, add additional actions, comments and evidence
- Complete an assessment on behalf of the accountable person (Observation)
- Approve or reject individual questions and/or submissions
- Create a plan to close the identified gaps.
