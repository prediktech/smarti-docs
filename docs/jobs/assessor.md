# Assessor 
One of the primary responsibilities of the Assessor is to review assessments that have been submitted. An assessor does not complete assessments and cannot be assigned assessments. They are, however, able to review and adjust submissions as required.

> NB: An assessor is able to modify responses on behalf of the accountable person. The assessor is also able to add actions, comments and evidence as needed.

The review tab highlights issues to be corrected prior to submission approval.

Assessors will likely have the ability to create assessment submissions, allocate those submissions and then review the results when they have been completed.

Approved submissions will contain a number of actions that have been agreed upon between the organisation, accountable user and the assessor. These actions form the "Maturity Plan" for the next period. If the planning module is enabled and the assessor has planning rights they can also create detailed plans to track and prioritise the maturity activities.
