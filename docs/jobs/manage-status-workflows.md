# Managing Status and workflows

> You must be a System Admin to manage status and workflows.

All users are able to view statuses and workflows.

Statuses are company-based. Only custom statuses are allowed to have the name changed and be deleted.

## Status List
Accessed via the Settings menu

From this page, you are able to add new statuses, edit, copy and edit permissions of existing statuses.

When you edit the permissions for a status you set the ability of each role to complete different actions within that status.
