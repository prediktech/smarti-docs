## Answering Questions
Once you have entered the assessment questions page you are shown a list of questions for a specific maturity level. Assessments can have one or more maturity levels.

Once you are able to answer all questions on a maturity level as "Yes" then the maturity score will increase. A score of 2.4 for instance indicates that you are currently on a maturity level 2 and you have answered 40% of the maturity level 3 questions as "Yes". Answers for higher-level maturity levels are not shown and do not affect the score until the current maturity level has been completed. (Reports are able to extract these additional results if they are needed).

If you answer **No** to a question it is recommended that you create an **action** to indicate how this situation will be resolved in the future.
