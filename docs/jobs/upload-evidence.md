# Uploading evidence

When completing an assessment, it is important to provide evidence for those questions you answer as _YES_. If you do not provide evidence, this may result in errors or warnings at the review stage, and ultimately the assessment being rejected.

To upload evidence related to a question, click on the evidence icon ![Image](/assets/screenshots/jobs/evidenceIcon.png).  This will open a dialog window. 

You have two options: create a new evidence record, or link an existing evidence record.

## Create new record
Click _"CREATE EVIDENCE RECORD"_.

Add a name for the evidence record, and click _"SAVE"_. This creates the record. Links or documents may be added/uploaded to the evidence record by clicking on the Links or Documents fields to reveal the _"ADD LINK"_ and _"SELECT FILES"_ buttons.
