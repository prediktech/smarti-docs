# Updating actions

As actions are undertaken and completed, it is important to keep track of their progress, particularly if they form part of a plan.  
Updating the status of an action may be completed from the My Tasks page, or by accessing through a submission.

All actions assigned to a user are displayed in the Actions area of My Tasks (landing page)
