# Approval Workflow
The approval workflow is provided to allow for opportunities to discuss the submissions and make corrections/adjustments quickly.

**Pending:** When a new version or new Iteration of a submission is created it is placed in the pending state.
Results, open actions and evidence records are carried over to the new version. 

**Submitted:** when the accountable person has completed and reviewed the submission they submit for approval. When submit is clicked the submission enters a “Submitted” state. The accountable person is able to “Retract” the submission and it will move back to the “Pending” state.

**Rejected:** If the entire submission requires changes then it can be rejected, it will then be set in a “Rejected” state. The accountable person is then able to make the required changes and resubmit. The assessor is able to reject individual questions or the entire submission. Best practice is for the Accountable and Assessor users to perform the review together and make adjustments as they go.

**Approved:** The submission is approved and a new version or iteration can be created.
