# Confirm Results
Once a submission has been approved by an assessor a new submission may be created and assigned. When this is done the results from the previous submission can be carried over. When the assessment questions are loaded the accountable user is expected to review and confirm the responses, evidence and actions for each Maturity Level.

Each new maturity level will first prompt for the results to be confirmed before you can continue.
