# Companies
The core of the system is based around the concept of users operating within an entity, we call these entities "Companies". You are not limited to companies; they can represent sites, departments or even teams. 

We do this because assessments are normally logically grouped in some way. You are able to create as many "Companies" as needed. Each company manages its own Users and Teams as well as the permissions assigned to those users.

This means that the same person in your organisation could be part of one or more "Companies" and have a different role with different permissions in each.

### Example:
Imagine we have a system set up with the following Companies/Sites.
- HQ
- East Region
- West Region

Bob is the "East Region" manager and he is accountable for the implementation of the management operating system (MOS). The group entity HQ is also implementing the new (MOS) practices at the organisational group level.

In this situation, Bob could be set up as the accountable person for the assessments within the "East Region" and also have the permissions for scheduling and managing the assessments in the "East Region". Bob, however, is only required to provide feedback at the "HQ" level so he will have a different set of permissions for that entity.

## Teams
Teams provide groupings of users within companies. Each team is given permissions.
